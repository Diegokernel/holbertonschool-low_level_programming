## 0x03. C - More functions, more nested loops

### Description
Learning more functions and more nested loops

### Concepts
At the end of this project you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

- What are nested loops and how to use them
- What is a function and how do you use functions
- What is the difference between a declaration and a definition of a function
- What is a prototype
- Scope of variables
- What are the gcc flags -Wall -Werror -pedantic -Wextra
- What are header files and how to to use them with #include

### File Content
This repository contains the following files:

| File | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| 0-isupper.c | Checks for uppercase character |
| 1-isdigit.c | Checks for a digit (`0` through `9`) |
| 2-mul.c | Multiplies two integers |
| 3-print_numbers.c | Prints the numbers, from `0` to `9`, followed by a new line |
| 4-print_most_numbers.c | Prints the numbers, from `0` to `9`, followed by a new line |
| 5-more_numbers.c | Prints 10 times the numbers, from `0` to `14`, followed by a new line |
| 6-print_line.c | Draws a straight line in the terminal |
| 7-print_diagonal.c | Draws a diagonal line on the terminal |
| 8-print_square.c | Prints a square, followed by a new line |
| 9-fizz_buzz.c | Prints from `1` to `100`, followed by a new line. But for multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number and for the multiples of five print Buzz. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print FizzBuzz |
| holberton.h | Contains all headers & prototypes use in the files above |
